📊 Survey Data Analysis – Power Query, Python & Google BigQuery


📌 Objective

To analyze customer satisfaction survey data using a hybrid approach:

Power Query Editor for dataset cleaning and preprocessing.

Python (Jupyter Notebook) for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Google BigQuery (SQL) to solve analytical problems and run large-scale queries.

The project delivers insights into customer satisfaction, wait times, agent performance, and multilingual survey responses to guide business improvements.

🎯 Key Goals

✅ Clean and preprocess survey dataset using Power Query Editor.

✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python to visualize satisfaction patterns.

✅ Use Google BigQuery SQL to query, transform, and validate survey data.

✅ Analyze relationships between wait time, agent performance, and satisfaction.

✅ Build correlation visualizations and trend analysis.

🛠️ Tools Used

Power Query Editor → Data cleaning, transformation, preprocessing.

Python (Jupyter Notebook) → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA & visualization.

Google BigQuery (SQL) → Querying, problem solving, data transformation at scale.

Excel → Validation and initial exploration.
